Not used these two but they could be useful

Things I would have done if the task allowed for more time.

- Add TypeScript
- Include player statistics (at both national and club level)
- Include previous squad selections
- improved UI layout so that equally good to view on mobile, tablet, and desktop. at present, it's
  optimised more towards tablet and desktop, but not so much for mobile.
- would have shown the starting line up in their formation positions, and would have allowed for
  players to be moved around positions eg. moving an LCB to RCB, an LW to RW etc.
